      <br>

      <p>
      <h2>To be Client centered:
      </h2>
    Our tag line is “Let us help you tell your story.” We respect our clients, understand their needs and wants, and listen. Serving our clients is our highest priority.
    To continue to pursue growth and knowledge and share it:
    Cheii’s never stop learning. We look for ways to challenge ourselves to learn, and grow. We spend time watching video tutorials, business lectures and slide presentations. When we collectively teach each other, we all stand to gain from it.
      <h2>Be Team-Oriented:
      </h2>
    Great teams are made up of great people. We help each other, we collaborate, and we celebrate our achievements.
    Build a positive team and family spirit:
    Our best ideas are made when we are surrounded by people we care for. Having a positive and inviting attitude inspires everyone around. We share this family spirit with clients and strive to build relationships with everyone we meet and work with.
      <h2>Humanity:
      </h2>
    We believe that is our duty to serve our Church’s Mission. A portion of our earnings go to the Church for outreach and ministries.
      <h2>To Communicate openly and honestly:
      </h2>
    When interacting with others, we encourage open communication and honesty. This leads to strong relationships built on trust.
      <h2>To be one with our Navajo Culture:
      </h2>
    We understand our Navajo culture and share when possible. We understand that culture and technology can go hand in hand.
      <h2>To care for all of creation:
      </h2>
    Take care of the company and clients as they were one’s own family. This also means taking care of creation, which is part of our culture. By taking care of creation, we: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.

                <h1 id="standOut">About Us</h1>
                <br>

                <br>

                <p>
                    We are an all Navajo Web Development Shop and active members of the Episcopal Church. We each grew up on the Navajo reservation and are cradle Episcopalians. Each of us bring various backgrounds to the table and had to overcome difficult obstacles in our lives. We grew up on the reservation where alcoholism is an epidemic, where children live in homes plagued with domestic violence and the struggle of not knowing where your next meal is coming from because full time work is scarce. We are stronger now and with the help of the church, we strive to build a great company to better the future for our selves, for our families, for our church and our church families. Being a product of The Episcopal Church in Navajoland we strive to become a standalone business by helping other church’s, other businesses, and artists tell the world who they are. In doing so, we also strive to help sustain The Episcopal Church in Navajoland for future generations: To help our people, to preserve our culture, and our way of life.
