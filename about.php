                                We are an all Navajo Web Development Shop and active members of the Episcopal Church. We each grew up on the Navajo reservation and are cradle Episcopalians. Each of us bring various backgrounds to the table and had to overcome difficult obstacles in our lives. We grew up on the reservation where alcoholism is an epidemic, where children live in homes plagued with domestic violence and the struggle of not knowing where your next meal is coming from because full time work is scarce. We are stronger now and with the help of the church, we strive to build a great company to better the future for our selves, for our families, for our church and our church families. Being a product of The Episcopal Church in Navajoland we strive to become a standalone business by helping other church’s, other businesses, and artists tell the world who they are. In doing so, we also strive to help sustain The Episcopal Church in Navajoland for future generations: To help our people, to preserve our culture, and our way of life.
