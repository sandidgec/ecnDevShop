The new craze right now is marketing videos that are in the form of white board animation, cartoon animation with music and voice overs. Most animations are included with the software, but we can also do custom background and people animations. We have an example up online and will make more soon. Clients can choose how they want it to look, how many slides, custom animations, write a script and provide voice overs or we can do voice overs or purchase professional voice overs for a separate price.

                        <p class="lead">Logo design is all around us. To the general public, logos serve as an instant
                            reminder of a company or a product; to the client they're the point of recognition on which
                            their branding hangs; and to us designers they represent the challenge of incorporating our
                            clients' ideologies into one single graphic.  In an age where everyone must have a website to
                            support their product, service or the company behind it, the demand for a top-class logo has never been higher.
                            More logo designs are out there than ever before, and with that comes the challenge of being different.
                            How do you create something original that stands out in a sea of identities? And how do we
                            create something quickly while retaining quality?  Here at Cheii’s Web Development, we can help.
