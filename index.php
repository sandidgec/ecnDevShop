        Meeting different artist at various art events, I hand them my
        business card with our website to market our services for web development.
        When the artist arrives to our website, they are greeted with a hero page;
        containing a stylized navbar with links to our different pages (About, Services and Contact).
        Customer goes to our "Services" pages to see what kind of services we provide.
        Within the services page are listed services; CSS, PHP, HTML and Javascript.
        Along with our sevices pages, is a brief description about what developer
        specializes in that particular service offered.

        A developer was on her way to a conference, she stops in at a irish
        restaurant.  While she was eating,  she overheard a customer talking
        about developing a customer database for a local church..  she noted
        the enthusiasm in the tone.  Immediately, after eating, of course.
        She approached the customer and inquired about what kind of developing
        methods were involved. the developer was impressed about the idea..and
        was immediately directed to the website.  She was impressed with the
        site map and found the answers that she needed. In the morning before
        she left town she stopped by the church and wrote a check because
        she believed it was a good cause.
